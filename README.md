## Installation
(Aspirational) Once on CRAN:
```r
install.packages("oRaklE")
```

Alternatively, install the development version


```r
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("Autarky-Power/oraklE_R")
```

Install requirements:
```r
packages <- c("caret","countrycode","doParallel","dplyr","ggplot2","ggthemes","glmnet","httr",
             "jsonlite","lubridate","MLmetrics","MuMIn","parallel","patchwork","purrr","R.utils",
              "readxl", "xml2")
install.packages(setdiff(packages, rownames(installed.packages())))
```

```r
library("oRaklE")
```

## Usage

### Get and prepare the data
As a first step, the package gets the load data from the Transparency Platform of the European Network of
Transmission System Operators for Electricity (ENTSO-E) [https://transparency.entsoe.eu/](https://transparency.entsoe.eu/). If the country is not a member of the ENTSO-E a dataset needs to be supplied manually. An example with South African load data is included at the end of this section. 

```r
# Get initial Data
demand_data = get_entsoE_data(2017,2021,"France")
```

![Load](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/24450818-c869-4142-a5b3-cb2a2ec7ff36)

The next step checks for missing data and replaces NaN values with the load data one week prior at the same time. So a missing value on a Thursday at 8 pm will be filled with the load value at 8 pm the week before. It also adjusts the dataset to account for changes in time resolution, ensuring that the data is standardized to an hourly resolution. For example, French load data is reported at an hourly resolution from 2017 to 2021 and at a half-hourly resolution from 2022 onwards. Therefore, it is recommended to run this function, even if there are no missing values.

```r
# Fill missing values
demand_data_filled = fill_missing_data(demand_data)
```

After the data is downloaded and standardized, the load time series is decomposed into three components: a yearly long-term trend, a daily mid-term seasonality, and an hourly short-term seasonality. If the data is available only at a daily resolution, the calculation of hourly seasonality is skipped. 


```r
# Decompose the load data
demand_data_filled = fill_missing_data(demand_data)
```

![Decomposed_load](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e5db1014-6e2b-4632-ab00-5923e8414553)

The function returns a list of three dataframes â€”one for each time series component:

- `demand_data$longterm`
- `demand_data$midterm`
- `demand_data$shortterm`
  
In the following steps, each time series will be modelled individually.

### Calculate and show the best long-term models
First, historical data from the ENTSO-E archive, starting from 2006, is added to the long-term trend series.
A dataset with historic yearly demand data for each ENTSOE-E member country is included in the library.

```r
# Get historical data for the respective country
longterm <- get_historic_load_data(decomposed_data$longterm)
```

The long-term electricity demand trend is estimated with different regression algorithms based on macro-economic covariates. 10 macro-economic indicators are fetched via an API call to the [Worldbank Development Indicators](https://databank.worldbank.org/source/world-development-indicators). Additional macro-economic covariates can be added manually.

```r
# Get macro-economic covariates for the respective country
longterm_all_data <- get_macro_economic_data(longterm)

head(longterm_all_data)
 country   year  avg_hourly_demand    population        GDP         industrial_value_added   ...
  FR       2006        54417.12        63628261     2.279283e+12           19.28408
  FR       2007        54769.12        64021737     2.334550e+12           19.13674
  FR       2008        56214.75        64379696     2.340502e+12           18.81383
  FR       2009        55409.97        64710879     2.273252e+12           18.30484
  ...
```
It should be noted that the average hourly demand (*avg_hourly_demand*) refers to the average demand over each hour of the respective year (typically in MW). If the complete demand over one year is of interest it can be calculated by multiplying the *avg_hourly_demand* times 8760 hours. 
After the dataset is fully prepared the best long-term prediction models are derived with multiple linear regression and k-fold cross-validation. Details on the mathematical approach are specified in the accompanying paper. The variable for *test_set_steps* defines how many years are used for the test set (also commonly referred to as validation set). The *testquant* variable defines how many of the initial best models are subjected to cross-validation.

```r
# Calculate the best prediction models
longterm_predictions <- long_term_lm(longterm_all_data,test_set_steps = 2, testquant = 500)
```

The three best models as well as plots for each model are generated and saved.

Once the best models are derived, future predictions can be made

```r
longterm_future_macro_data <- long_term_future_data(longterm_predictions, end_year = 2028, dataset = "WEO")
```

```r
longterm_future_predictions <- long_term_future(longterm_future_macro_data)
```

```r
# Midterm model
midterm_demand_data = add_holidays_mid_term(decomposed_data$midterm)
midterm_demand_and_weather_data = get_weather_data(midterm_demand_data)
midterm_predictions = mid_term_lm(midterm_demand_and_weather_data$demand, Tref = 18, method = "temperature transformation")
midterm_future_predictions = mid_term_future(midterm_predictions, end_year = 2028)

# Shortterm model
shortterm_demand_data= add_holidays_short_term(decomposed_data$shortterm)
shortterm_predictions <- short_term_lm(shortterm_demand_data)
shortterm_future_predictions = short_term_future(shortterm_predictions,end_year = 2028)

# Combine all models
full_model_predictions <- combine_models(example_longterm_predictions,example_midterm_predictions,example_shortterm_predictions,longterm_model_number =1)
full_model_future_predictions <- combine_models_future(longterm_future_predictions,midterm_future_predictions,
                                                       shortterm_future_predictions,longterm_model_number =1)
```
