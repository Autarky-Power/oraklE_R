# COMMENT
Pls omit the redundant " The 'oRaklE' package is designed "

Is there some reference about the method you can add in the Description
field in the form Authors (year) <doi:10.....>?

# ANSWER
I included 2 studies in the description file. Additionally, I am planning to submit a detailed paper regarding the package and the applied method to a journal for statistical software.
